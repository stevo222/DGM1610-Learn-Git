5. So what I want to do is be a video game developer, but that job alone is very tricky to make a stable income so I'm actually going into secondary Education and teach game development while I do that on the side.  Why accounting is important is because you are running a business.  You need to keep track of the expenses and income of your game, keep spreadsheets and all the assets the game is worth, and the liabilities involved for development. You also have to keep in mind the taxes and other financial responsibilities it would be to make a video game.  Keep in mind at the end of the day it is a business.
